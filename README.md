# Scott Garner 
Heyo!  I'm Scott and currently a graduate student in theoretical chemistry at UC Berkeley.

## My Background
I'm formally trained as a chemist, but I'm frequently following interests as they ebb and flow.  Common themes are Quantum Chemistry, The History of Computing, and Design of all forms.

##  My Research
Read more about my research on the electronic structure of core excitations via [Quantum Monte Carlo]{https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0020310} or [Excited State Mean Field Theory]{https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0020595}. *PS I too hate paywalls*
