# Scott Garner 
Heyo!  I'm Scott and currently a PostDoc in theoretical chemistry at Princeton.  I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley and my undergrad at Ohio State.

## My Background
I'm formally trained as a chemist, but I'm frequently following interests as they ebb and flow.  Common themes are Quantum Chemistry, history told through science, design of all forms, 

##  My Research
I'm primarily interested in excited state chemical dynamics and spectorscopy.  Follow my latest work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_tpFp4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
